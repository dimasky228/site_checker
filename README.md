# site_checker
This project was made to learn FastApi and how to use httpx. It is very simple project that can provide you an information about site's availability and return https code.

Well there are 3 main files in it. main_without_web is a file which has only small script that will provide you an information and I used transcript to make user easily understand a definition to each code. I used FastApi.
main_with_simple_web is the same file, but with small web interface, that can be used for your ideas, I know that it can't output an answer of codes, but I believe that I will remake it and do it better. Also I will make a frontend by using JS, HTML and ofc ourse css.
Of course there are a lot of things, which you can do better, than be, but overall while I was making that project and I undestood a lot of things, thus I will stude more. Any cooments and critics you can write.
